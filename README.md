# WebScrapingPrograms

Points To Remember: (For Coursera Webscrape Program)

1) As said in the code, this program will give you courses based on the intersection of the skills inputted, so if you put Machine Learning and Pyhton Programming, it will return only the courses where both skills will be taught
   
2) One thing to be wary of is typos while entering skills, this program does not deal with skill typos, and will not return any courses, it will simply say " No such courses were found" and give you an inaccurate result
   
3) One thing that is possible is you can even enter a word of the skill you have, so like, just "machine" can give you courses which have 'machine learning' in them, however this is not recommended

Points to Note: (For Manhwa Update Tracker)

1) The program will check through a list of URLs that lead to the manhwas(which explained in the most simple way, are comics that update weekly, but at an irregular schedule, hence the need for the program) that I read and see if it has updated, if it has, it emails me to notify me
