from email.message import EmailMessage  # From here to the next line is all modules to help carry out emailing
import smtplib

import sys  # This is to catch the line at which error has happened and return that value along with the reason, in the email that is sent regarding exception occurrence

# This dictionary stores the links of 6 manhwa which I regularly follow and web scrapes the sites every day to see if it has updated or not, the key value contains the scrape link, where the info about the manhwa in specific is scraped, while the value tuple contains the link to the site where I usually read from and the image address to be used in the email when an update notification is sent

# Also "%b" gives you the abbreviated form of the month in text, as in "Sep" from "September", while "%B" would give you the whole "September", "%d" give you the date, but tbh you don't need to use datetime.now() for that, date.today().day works just as fine, but I used the former because it would be in the same format as the other two, so yeah...
